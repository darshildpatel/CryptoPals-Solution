First of all I read the file and find the key length using the average of the normalized humming distance. Then we divide the input string in to chunks of 29 which is the optimal key length that we guessed in the previous step. After we have a list of chunks we take transpose of the whole list so that we have 29 different strings with first character of all the strings. Then we use the single_byte_xor_cipher function the we created in the previous questions to guess the single byte of key. Doing this for 29 times would give us the appropriate string key. late we decode the whole file."

Then we implement AES using new() functions mentioning ECB as mode. We simply decrypt the file from base64 and convert it into ascii before printing."
